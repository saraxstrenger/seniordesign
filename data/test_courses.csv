Working in teams of two, students will design and develop an authoring tool that that facilitates the creation of a new type of user interaction, animation/simulation capability or 3D graphics special effect. Research papers published in the SigGraph Conference proceedings will provide the basis for the features/functionality/special effects that can be selected for implementation in the authoring tool. Each group will analyze the need and user requirements for the tool they plan to develop, prepare a formal software design document, construct a project work plan, develop the authoring tool functionality and user interface, test the design and demonstratthe authoring of associated content. A plug-in to standard authoring tools such as Maya or Houdini must also be developed to enable importing of appropriate assets and/or exporting of results."

CIS 6700 Advanced Topics in Programming Languages,1,4,"The details of this course change from year to year, but its purpose is to cover theoretical topics related to programming languages. Some central topics include: denotational vs operational semantics, domain theory and category theory, the lambda calculus, type theory (including recursive types, generics, type inference and modules), logics of programs and associated completeness and decidability problems, specification languages, and models of concurrency. The course requires a degree of mathematical sophistication."

CIS 6730 Computer-Aided Verification,5,4,"This course introduces the theory and practice of formal methods for the design and analysis of concurrent and embedded systems. The emphasis is on the underlying logical and automata-theoretic concepts, the algorithmic solutions, and heuristics to cope with the high computational complexity. Topics: Models and semantics of reactive systems; Verification algorithms; Verification techniques. Topics may vary depending on instructor. Basic knowledge of algorithms, data structures, automata theory, propositional logic, operating systems, communication protocols, and hardware (, , or permission of the instructor)."

CIS 6770 Advanced Topics in Algorithms and Complexity,2,2,"This course covers various aspects of discrete algorithms. Graph-theoretic algorithms in computational biology, and randomization and computation; literature in dynamic graph algorithms, approximation algorithms, and other areas according to student interests. Consent of the instructor."

CIS 6800 Advanced Topics in Machine Perception,1,3,"Graduate seminar in advanced work on machine perception as it applies to robots as well as to the modeling of human perception. Topics vary with each offering. A previous course in machine perception or knowledge of image processing, experience with an operating system and language such as Unix and C, and aptitude for mathematics."

CIS 6820 Friendly Logics,4,5,"The use of logical formalisms in Computer Science is dominated by a fundamental conflict: expressiveness vs. algorithmic tractability. Database constraint logics, temporal logics and description logics are successful compromises in this conflict: (1) they are expressive enough for practical specifications in certain areas, and (2) there exist interesting algorithms for the automated use of these specifications. Interesting connections can be made between these logics because temporal and description logics are modal logics, which in turn can be seen, as can database constraint logics, as certain fragments of first-order logic. These connections might benefit research in databases, computer-aided verification and AI. Discussion includes other interesting connections, eg., with SLD-resolution, with constraint satisfaction problems, with finite model theory and with automata theory."

CIS 7980 Explaining Explanation,1,3,"In the social sciences we often use the word ""explanation"" as if (a) we know what we mean by it, and (b) we mean the same thing that other people do. In this course we will critically examine these assumptions and their consequences for scientific progress. In part 1 of the course we will examine how, in practice, researchers invoke at least three logically and conceptually distinct meanings of ""explanation:"" identification of causal mechanisms; ability to predict (account for variance in) some outcome; and ability to make subjective sense of something. In part 2 we will examine how and when these different meanings are invoked across a variety of domains, focusing on social science, history, business, and machine learning, and will explore how conflation of these distinct concepts may have created confusion about the goals of science and how we evaluate its progress. Finally , in part 3 we will discuss some related topics such as null hypothesis testing and the replication crisis. We will also discuss specific practices that could help researchers clarify exactly what they mean when they claim to have ""explained"" something, and how adoption of such practices may help social science be more useful and relevant to society."

CIS 8990 Doctoral Independent Study,3,2,"For doctoral students studying a specific advanced subject area in computer and information science. The Independent Study may involve coursework, presentations, and formally gradable work comparable to that in a or 6000 level course. The Independent Study may also be used by doctoral students to explore research options with faculty, prior to determining a thesis topic. Students should discuss with the faculty supervisor the scope of the Independent Study, expectations, work involved, etc. The Independent Study should not be used for ongoing research towards a thesis, for which the designation should be used."
