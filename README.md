# Compass

Welcome to Compass, our (Janavi Chadha, Suvas Kota, Saurabh Shah, Sara Strenger, Kat Wang) Senior Design Project! 
Compass aims to provide useful course reccomendations to Penn students. Right now we are focusing on two types of reccomendations:
1. Reccomending based on career interests/goals
2. Reccomending based on predicted interest scores

(1) Is implemented using modern neural embeddings (e.g. BERT and family) while (2) is implemented using classical collaborative filtering.
